# Pokedex

Misty displays Pokédex for generation V Pokémon with bump sensors as control. Press the left bump sensors to go to the previous Pokémon. Press the right bump sensors to go the next Pokémon.

For each Pokémon, Misty will

- Display the pokemon name
- Display the Pokémon's animated sprite
- Change LED color according to the Pokémon type (if the Pokémon has 2 types, the LED will flip flop between the two)

The data is retrieved from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). To reduce network requests, the Pokémon data is saved locally after fetched.
