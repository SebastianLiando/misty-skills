# Stupid Wandering

![Status: Discontinued](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-discontinued-red)

Misty wanders around until it bumps to any object. When it bumps, Misty will scream and turn towards another direction. This skill is no longer developed due to Misty's rotation issue and to prevent damage to the asset.

This skill is inspired from [Michael Reeves roomba video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvz3LRK263E).
